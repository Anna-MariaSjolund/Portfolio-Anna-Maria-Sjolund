# Anna-Maria Sjölund

A couple of years ago I decided it was time for a career change. With a research master's degree in behavioural science and skills in advanced statistics (using R), research methods, problem solving and critical thinking, I came to the conclusion that a career in data science was the way to go. In the autumn of 2021, I began my studies in AI and machine learning at IT-högskolan. 

The program at IT-högskolan has been a mix of theory and practice, focusing on programming in Python and building the solid foundation needed for studying machine learning and deep learning.

Below, you will find some examples of what I have learned so far (more examples can be found in the repositories for the courses).

### Portfolio :briefcase: 

| Link | Description | Course |
-------|-------------|--------|
|[Dogs vs. Cats](https://github.com/Anna-MariaSjolund/Deep-Learning-Anna-MariaSjolund/blob/main/labs/lab-dogs-vs-cats.ipynb) | I created a convolutional neural network for classifying dogs and cats. I also improved the predictions by using data augmentation and by fine-tuning a pretrained network. | Deep Learning |
|[Disease Prediction](https://github.com/Anna-MariaSjolund/Machine-learning-Anna-MariaSjolund/blob/main/labs/lab_disease_prediction.ipynb) | I predicted cardiovascular disease, using different machine learning methods. | Machine Learning |
|[Movie Recommendation](https://github.com/Anna-MariaSjolund/Machine-learning-Anna-MariaSjolund/blob/main/labs/lab_movie_recommendations.ipynb)| I used KNN for making movie recommendations. | Machine Learning |
|[Olympic Games Dashboard](https://olympic-games-usa.herokuapp.com/) | Dashboard created together with a classmate. I was responsible for the USA data. | Data Handling|
|[Predicting House Prices](https://github.com/Anna-MariaSjolund/Introduction-to-AI/blob/main/PredictingHousePricesUsingLinearRegression.md)| An essay, written during the first course at ITHS. | Introduction to AI |
