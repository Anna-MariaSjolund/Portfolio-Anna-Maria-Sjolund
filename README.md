# Anna-Maria Sjölund

My passion for science has taken me from a bachelor's degree, with a major in psychology, to attaining a research master in behavioural science. Due to the limited possibilities in Sweden in this field, it also took me from Gothenburg to Nijmegen in the Netherlands and back again. 

It was during my two years at Radboud University that I first came into contact with programming, as part of the master programme. We used R for statistical analyses (such as regression and SEM) and also for programming simple experiments in Python. After I had moved back to Sweden, I worked as a research assistant in a qualitative project in developmental psychology at the University of Gothenburg. Even though this work was very rewarding, I missed a more quantitative approach. 

In August 2021 I started my studies in AI and machine learning at IT-högskolan in Gothenburg. I look forward to the studies and hope to be able to draw parallels between my previous experiences in psychology and the new ones that I will gain in the field of AI, machine learning and deep learning.
