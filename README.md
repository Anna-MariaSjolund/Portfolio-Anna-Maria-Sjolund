# Anna-Maria Sjölund

About a year ago I decided it was time for a career change. With a research master's degree in behavioral science and skills in advanced statistics (using R), research methods, problem solving and critical thinking, I came to the conclusion that a career in data science was the way to go. Last autumn, I began my studies in AI and machine learning at IT-högskolan. 

The program at IT-högskolan has been a mix of theory and practice, focusing on programming in Python and building the solid foundation needed for studying machine learning and deep learning this spring. 

Below, you will find some examples of what I have learned so far.
